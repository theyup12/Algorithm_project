## Project 2: Polynomial versus Exponential Time

This project will test the following hypotheses:
1. Exhaustive search algorithms are feasible to implement, and produce correct outputs.
2. Recursion is not always slow, because recursion-based algorithms can be faster than loop-based algorithms.
3. Algorithms with exponential or factorial running times are extremely slow, probably too slow to be of practical use.
To test this hypothesis, you will implement:
1. an O(n^3)-time exhaustive search algorithm for the maximum subarray problem;
2. an O(nlog(n))-time decrease-by-half algorithm for the same problem; and
3. an O(nâ‹…2^n)-time exhaustive search algorithm for the subset sum problem.
