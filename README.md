## Project 1: Empirical Analysis
This project will test the following hypothesis:
 For large values of n, the mathematically-derived efficiency class of an algorithm accurately predicts the observed running time of an implementation of that algorithm.
1. Dip search problem
2. Longest Balanced Span problem
3. Telegraph style string problem
4. 
## Project 2: Polynomial versus Exponential Time

This project will test the following hypotheses:
1. Exhaustive search algorithms are feasible to implement, and produce correct outputs.
2. Recursion is not always slow, because recursion-based algorithms can be faster than loop-based algorithms.
3. Algorithms with exponential or factorial running times are extremely slow, probably too slow to be of practical use.
To test this hypothesis, you will implement:
1. an O(n^3)-time exhaustive search algorithm for the maximum subarray problem;
2. an O(nlog(n))-time decrease-by-half algorithm for the same problem; and
3. an O(nâ‹…2^n)-time exhaustive search algorithm for the subset sum problem.
